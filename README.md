oasis is an R package based on the paper: [OASIS is Automated Statistical Inference for Segmentation, with applications to multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation in MRI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2013.03.002) by Sweeney et al.  This package implements the model and the processing stream, which is based in FSL, that is ported to R through [fslr](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2015-1/muschelli-sweeney-lindquist-etal.pdf).
